Just past the field of sunflowers you’ll ride into town and over the Pavé Sprint Reverse segment, then it’s past more fields and up the short Aqueduc KOM Reverse.\n\nThe largest climb of the route is next, the Petit KOM. (Now we’re riding roads we’ve already covered, but in the other direction!) Climb those zigzags then descend past the start pens, turning right to ride the twisty road along the river and past the hot air balloons once more, onto the Ballon Sprint.\n\nTurn left and hit the Aqueduc KOM and Pavé Sprint, ride around to the marina and a Marina Sprint, then past the start pens and up the climb to the Petit KOM banner to finish.

This is a technical KOM with constantly-changing road pitches and scenery – getting your best time here requires heads-up riding and of course, hard effort!\n\nOnce you’re through the Rooftop KOM banner it’s time for a twisty descent, then you’ll make your way out of Neokyo. Past the Clifftop Shrine and into Yumezi Tunnel, you may just find yourself blinking in the sunlight of Yumezi as you exit the other side.\n\nEnjoy the flats of the farmlands for a bit, then you’ll climb up the Castle KOM before heading across to start the dirt Temple KOM from the Fishing Village side.\n\nOnce you’re through the Temple KOM banner in the Giant Mystical Tree it’s a dirt descent back to the Castle area and onto the road you came in on. Through Yumezi tunnel into Neokyo’s permanight, and your virtual finish line is just up the road!",

This bypasses the usual flat London start so you can get climbing quickly – let the suffering begin!\n\nOnce you’re in the Surrey Hills, you will continue to ride this route, never going back into the city or crossing the start/finish banner.\n\nYou’ll ride up 4 timed KOM climbs on this route. First Fox Hill for the lead-in, then the route begins atop Fox/Box. Next you’ll climb Leith hill – the longest climb of the day.\n\nOne weird thing about how this route works is it dumps you onto the Box Hill KOM after the start line, which means you won’t get on the Box Hill leaderboard in Zwift. But you will climb (almost) all of it!\n\nThen it’s on to Keith Hill, then one final go up Fox Hill. The route ends at the KOM banner atop Fox/Box.",
